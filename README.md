## I'm Aaron Jung ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Computer Science undergraduate at Purdue University Northwest with a focus on building real-world applications. I primarily work with C# and React/Next.js, and Iâ€™ve also gained experience in robotics and systems design through both coursework and extracurricular projects.

In my free time, I enjoy 3D Printing, gaming, and jumping between many codebases.

âš¡ **Fun Fact**: I have 5 Cats!
